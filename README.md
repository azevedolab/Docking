# Docking Screens for Drug Discovery (2nd Edition)
<p>
Here you will find links to Jupyter Notebooks discussed in the second edition of the book Docking Screens for Drug Discovery. This new edition concentrates on the development of computational models to predict binding affinity based on the atomic coordinates of protein-ligand complexes. All codes are Python snippets based on the program <a href = "https://github.com/azevedolab/sandres#readme" title = "SAnDReS 2.0: Development of machine-learning models to explore the scoring function space">SAnDReS 2.0</a> (<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.27449" title = "de Azevedo WF Jr, Quiroga R, Villarreal MA, da Silveira NJF, Bitencourt-Ferreira G, da Silva AD, Veit-Acosta M, Oliveira PR, Tutone M, Biziukova N, Poroikov V, Tarasova O, Baud S. SAnDReS 2.0: Development of machine-learning models to explore the scoring function space. J Comput Chem. 2024 Oct 15;45(27):2333-2346. doi: 10.1002/jcc.27449. Epub 2024 Jun 20. PMID: 38900052.">de Azevedo et al., 2024</a>). You will also find data about the statistical analysis of machine learning models developed using <a href = "https://github.com/azevedolab/sandres#readme" title = "SAnDReS 2.0: Development of machine-learning models to explore the scoring function space">SAnDReS 2.0</a>.
As in the first edition, this book focuses on recent developments in docking simulations for target proteins with chapters on specific techniques or applications for docking simulations, including the major docking programs. Additionally, the volume explores the scoring functions developed for the analysis of docking results and to predict ligand-binding affinity as well as the importance of docking simulations for the initial stages of drug discovery. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, this collection presents the kind of detail and key implementation advice to ensure successful results.

My scientific interests are interdisciplinary, with three main emphases: artificial intelligence, complex systems, and computational systems biology. In my studies, I developed several free software to explore the concept of <a href = "https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/84362" title = "Heck GS, Pintro VO, Pereira RR, de Ávila MB, Levin NMB, de Azevedo WF. Supervised Machine Learning Methods Applied to Predict Ligand- Binding Affinity. Curr Med Chem. 2017;24(23):2459-2470.">Scoring Function Space</a>. As a result of my research, I published over 200 scientific work about protein structures, computer models of complex systems, and simulations of protein systems. These publications generated over 8,000 citations and an <a href = "https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7006435557" title = "de Azevedo Junior, Walter Filgueira. Scopus ID: 7006435557">h-index of 50 in Scopus</a>.   

Due to the impact of my work, I have been ranked among the most influential researchers in the world (Fields: Biophysics, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and Biomedical Research) according to a database created by <a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33064726/" title = "Ioannidis JPA, Boyack KW, Baas J. Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators. PLoS Biol. 2020 Oct 16;18(10):e3000918. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000918.

The application of the same set of metrics recognized the influence of my work in the following years (

Not bad for a poor guy who was a shoe seller at a store in the city of São Paulo and had the gold opportunity to study at the University of São Paulo with a scholarship for food and housing. I was 23 when I initiated my undergraduate studies and the first in my family to have access to higher education.

Regarding scientific impact (<a href = "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rating-researchers" title = "Rating Researchers">Peterson, 2005</a>), Hirsch says that for a physicist, a value for the h index of 45 or higher could mean membership in the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. So far, there have been no invitations. No hard feelings because I am in good company. <a href = "https://theconversation.com/carl-sagans-scientific-legacy-extends-far-beyond-cosmos-240885" tiltle = "Carl Sagan’s scientific legacy extends far beyond ‘Cosmos’">Carl Sagan</a> was never allowed into the National Academy of Sciences. According to <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wd1k3voAAAAJ&hl=en" title = "Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a>, his work accumulates more than 1,000 citations per year. Indeed, his current citation rate exceeds that of many members of the <a href = "https://www.nasonline.org/membership/" title = "National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>.

“Social media gives the right to speak to legions of imbeciles who previously only spoke at the bar after a glass of wine, without damaging the community. They were immediately silenced, but now they have the same right to speak as a Nobel Prize winner. It’s the invasion of imbeciles.”
